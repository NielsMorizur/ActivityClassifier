# ActivityClassifier

This app takes a csv file as input, which contains accelerometer data from a person walking or jumping. It then classifies the data into 5 second segments of either walking or jumping based on a trained classifier model. This model was trained by using collected walking and jumping data from 3 users.

To run this project, run DesktopApp.py.
The app will take a little while to classify the input file and will then plot the output as a 1 for jumping and a 0 for walking.
